This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.

This is the first project from scratch for the Udacity Android Nanodegree program.

To make this app work, create an API key for themoviedatabase by following these instructions:
https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api

After getting the API key, place it in the app's build.gradle file by replacing {YOUR_API_KEY} string with your key.
Run the app after this.
